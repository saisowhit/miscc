What does it mean if my confidence interval includes zero?
If your confidence interval for a difference between groups includes zero, that means that if you run your experiment again you have a good chance of finding no difference between groups.

If your confidence interval for a correlation or regression includes zero, that means that if you run your experiment again there is a good chance of finding no correlation in your data.

In both of these cases, you will also find a high p-value when you run your statistical test, meaning that your results could have occurred under the null hypothesis of no relationship between variables or no difference between groups.



What is standard error?
The standard error of the mean, or simply standard error, indicates how different the population mean is likely to be from a sample mean. It tells you how much the sample mean would vary if you were to repeat a study using new samples from within a single population.


When should I remove an outlier from my dataset?
It’s best to remove outliers only when you have a sound reason for doing so.

Some outliers represent natural variations in the population, and they should be left as is in your dataset. These are called true outliers.

Other outliers are problematic and should be removed because they represent measurement errors, data entry or processing errors, or poor sampling.

2. What is the biggest challenge you have faced, and what steps did you take to overcome it?

The executives at my last company wanted to make better data-driven decisions.I was directed to streamline a dozen reports for our monthly
executive briefing.

I used data visualization tools to create a real-time comprehensive, automated dashboard.My approach saved the team over 25 hours monthly, helping them focus on more strategic projects.

What is your greatest weakness?
During project testing, I occasionally don’t elaborate enough on why a particular approach will have a low likelihood of success to junior data scientists on my team. As a senior data scientist, I am tasked with mentoring my direct reports and communicating effectively to avoid pitfalls during projects.To strengthen my abilities, I started taking a course on “Giving Helpful Feedback” from Coursera to expand my leadership skills and help those under me grow their expertise.By doing this, I was able to build more formidable relationships with my team and achieve superior business results.




I am a performance-driven inbound marketing professional with a demonstrated history in creating successful campaigns.For example, my previous role focused on optimizing lead generation and lead nurturing processes through high quality and targeted content.I created and executed email marketing, website updates and social media campaigns to grow customer acquisition.
These multi-channel marketing campaigns resulted in tripled conversion rates. I believe my proficiency in converting qualified leads into customers would make me an asset to your organization, and I would be eager to continue growing my expertise alongside your highly skilled team.

What accomplishment are you most proud of,
and why?
At my last company, I noticed there was no formal development program to help my peers who were promoted to a supervisor role for the first time. I spoke to my manager about starting a leadership boot camp, and he told me to challenge my thinking and come up with a strategy to implement it.
After collaborating with my leader and business partners, I was able to formulate a curriculum for a leadership development track, teaching my peers fundamental leadership skills and how to manage their teams efficiently.
I was able to successfully bring the program to life, allowing me to channel my passion for leadership while serving the community. Given the opportunity as your firm’s organizational development manager, I would love to carry the invaluable skills I learned to help future leaders at your organization.


Can you tell me about a time when you had to think creatively to overcome a challenge?" (with sample answers)


Good answer: "In my previous job as a graphic designer, a client wanted a logo design that was completely outside of our company style and brand guidelines. I knew that we needed to come up with a design that would meet the client's needs but still fit within our brand standards. I researched different design styles and came up with a unique, modern design that still incorporated our company colors and typography. The client loved it, and we ended up using that new style in other projects."

Tell me about a time when you didn’t meet a client’s expectation
Situation: “As a graphic designer, I misunderstood a client’s design brief and created a concept that was off-target.”
Task: “My task was to deliver a design that aligned with the client’s brand vision.”
Action: “After realizing the mistake, I scheduled a meeting with the client to discuss their vision in detail. I then worked overtime to deliver a new design that met their expectations.”
Result: “The client was satisfied with the new design and praised our commitment to meeting their needs. This experience improved my attention to detail and client communication skills.”


Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
Example answer: “ I can think back to a time when I was working closely with an external partner on planning an event. I was trying to set the schedule for my team, however, it would sometimes take two weeks before the external partner would email me back. I could definitely empathize with this as I know they mentioned they were managing multiple events, however, I also had to recognize that it was slowing down the planning for my team. What I did was first I would set a reminder for myself to follow up to my initial emails two days after I sent my first email. Next I determined setting up phone meetings might help the external partner communicate more information at once. This really helped in our ability to meet the deadlines we each needed.”

tell-me-about-a-time-you-set-a-goal-for-yourself-to-meet-an-objective

“In my last role as a digital marketer, I set a goal to increase our web traffic by 30% within six months. I started by analyzing our current traffic sources and performance metrics. Based on this analysis, I developed a comprehensive SEO and content strategy, which included regular blog posts, social media engagement, and keyword optimization. I also set up weekly check-ins to monitor progress. By the end of six months, we had achieved a 35% increase in traffic, surpassing my original goal.”

Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
When my previous team transitioned to a new project management software, I took the initiative to learn it quickly to ensure a smooth transition. I viewed the change as an opportunity for growth. I found the experience invigorating and threw myself into the tutorial videos to become competent before the first day of using the new system.
While some peers struggled to adapt, I helped them find their way around the new system. As a result, the department's output increased and the transition went smoothly. This experience helped me develop perseverance and adaptability

How do you react when you are dissatisfied with the quality of your work or the outcome of your work?
"I am rarely dissatisfied with my work because I keep very high standards for myself and what I deliver. With that said, should I be dissatisfied with the quality of my work, I would own up to it and try again until I was proud of the work I delivered."


Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment.
Describe a time when you had to step up and demonstrate leadership skills.
Tell me about a time you made a mistake and wish you’d handled a situation with a colleague differently.
When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs
Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?


3. Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?
A perfect answer to this question has an outstanding outcome and illustrates the process of getting to that result. But even if you only have a decent outcome to point to instead of a stellar one, spelling out the steps you took will get you a strong answer.

For instance:

“One of the most important times to make a good impression on a client is before they’re officially a client. When the sales team pulls me into meetings with potential clients, I know we’re close to sealing the deal and I do my best to help that along. That’s probably why I was chosen to represent the research team when we did a final presentation for what would become our biggest client win of the year. I spoke with everyone on the sales team who had met with them previously to learn as much as possible about what they might care about. The thing I do that sets me apart is that I don’t try to treat all the clients the same. I try to address their specific questions and concerns so that they know I did my homework and that I care enough to not just give the cookie-cutter answers. In this case, having the data pulled and ready for every question they had made all the difference in building their confidence in our company.”



Describe a time when you disagreed with a team member. How did you resolve the problem?
Tell me about a time when you failed.
Give me an example of when you had to assume leadership for a team.
What is the most difficult/ challenging situation you’ve ever had to resolved in the workplace?
Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a supervisor.
How do you approach problems? What’s your process?
Also, most behavioural interview questions can be separated into groups:

Problem Solving
Working on a Team
Biggest Failures
Leadership
Personal Stress
Now, let’s look at 8 of the most common questions from each group and a short description of the answering approach to use. We’ll look at examples of a few questions that may be relevant to tech startup interviews.

Problem Solving
1. Give me an example of when you used logic to solve a problem
Answering Tip: Employ a Situation/ Task→ Action→ Result format.

2. Explain a time when you took the initiative on a project.
Answering Tip: Tempting as it may be to focus only on yourself, don’t forget to give credit to your team, too. Try to use examples where you went beyond your day role to take on extra responsibility.

3. Describe how you used your problem-solving skills to benefit a team or company.
Answering Tip: Demonstrate how you look for solutions for the greater good of the company. Not just solutions for your own good and your team’s good.

Bonus Example: According to Bosmat, Engineering Manager at Facebook, the best way to demonstrate your problem solving skills (particularly if you’re applying for a software engineering role) is to think aloud.  The interview at Facebook for software engineering roles is part behavioural and part technical, and interviewers love to know how you think, so share your thought process openly, while using the tips the interviewers give you. Facebook also recommend familiarizing yourself with the company’s core values and vision, and joining their online talent community to network with hiring managers and other peers.

4. Tell me about a time when you used creativity to overcome a dilemma.
Answering Tip: Think about a way that you surprised yourself with an unexpected idea. Did you follow a ‘creative process’? Or was your creativity more spontaneous in the situation?

5. What’s the best idea you’ve come up with on a team-based project?
Answering Tip: Brainstorm at least three different ideas and be prepared to discuss one during your interview. Focus on the ones that had the biggest impact.

6. How do you approach problems? What’s your process?
Answering Tip: Focus on the approach you use to solve problems. How do you break them down into steps in order to solve them? What tools and techniques do you use to work through a problem?

7. Tell me about a time when you were consulted for a problem.
Answering Tip: The interviewer wants to know what you are known/remembered for among the people who know you. Do your friends come to you for relationship advice, professional advice or to brainstorm solutions? Do they ask you for places to visit around town? Think about what you know a lot about, and what your friends know & think about you too!

“We look for candidates who have a wider lens in understanding the impact of their own function, and most of all able to operate in a high growth environment with a desire to grow.”
Monica Watt, General Manager, Elmo Talent Learning

8. Name three improvements you made in your most recent position.
Answering Tip: Make a list so that you’re not stumbling over your words during the interview. Focus more on the result you achieved for this question, and have the ‘3 things’ ready to discuss.

Bonus Example: Think of a time when you’ve used an approach like Design Thinking Or Lean Startup methodology to come up with solutions to a problem. This demonstrates that you’re well versed in typical problem solving approaches used by advanced tech folks out there. Kevin Lee, Founder at PMHQ recommends asking clarifying questions and focusing on the end user, especially for Product Management Interviews at companies like Google. Who is it that you made the improvements for and why? What difference did your improvements make to your end users lives?

Working in a Team
9. Have you ever worked with a team before?
Answering Tip: Don’t just answer “yes” or “no,” but also describe your role(s) within any team you’ve worked within. Explain the focus of your team, the objectives you had and give detail on the size and growth during your time in the role.

10. Are you better at working with a team or working on your own?
Answering Tip: To answer that you’re a team player is almost always the right response.

11. Give me an example of when you worked well with a team.
Answering Tip: Make a list of these examples ahead of your interview so that you’re comfortable with these ideas. Focus on the times where you were able to deliver a business result, rather than just hanging out at the pub on a Friday.

12. What role do you assume when you work within a team?
Answering Tip: Although you may have assumed many different roles, focus on the one that showcases your skill set. Give a response that aligns with the current role you’re interviewing for

– for example, if the interview is for a leadership role then talk about your style in that capacity.

13. Have you worked on different types of teams? What was your favorite?
Answering Tip: Describe the benefit of each team you’ve worked within. Focus on the reasons why you enjoyed that team – if it was a personality and culture alignment, or you delivered an awesome project together, both work well.

14. What do you do if you disagree if another team member?
Answering Tip: Choose a time when you disagreed about a work-related issue, not a personal one, and explain how you tackled the case. Focus on your communication and negotiation skills. Try not to let your ego get in the way.

“To play sports at a competitive level you need to have a competitive mindset, be a real team player, have discipline and be open to new ways of getting better. If someone has played top-level sports I often a see them striving for the same success in their role.”
James Bergl, Sales Director at Datto

15. Describe a time when you disagreed with a team member. How did you resolve the problem?
Answering Tip: Explain how you worked through the issue – show off your communication skills, it’s ok if you didn’t come out of the disagreement on top, your interviewer is looking for your ability to handle conflict.

16. Tell me about a time when you failed in a team project, and how you overcame it.
Answering Tip: Be honest and show how you can learn from failures. Don’t blame your team members for your failure, focus on the objective reasons that led to team failure and what you learned.

Bonus Example: Using examples of a time when you’ve participated in a Hackathon usually works well for questions like this, especially if you had a good idea and got some recognition for it. This is a time where you would’ve generated a lot of ideas in collaboration with a team, in a short span of time and solved lots of problems. A great way to demonstrate that you can work well with a team in a ‘tech’ environment while also generating positive outcomes for your team.

Answering Tip: Choose a mistake from when you first started working on a job and describe your progression.

Answering Tip: Describe why you enjoy feedback, even in the form of failures. Present failures as lessons.

23. Tell me about a time when you tried something risky and failed.
Answering Tip: Bring humor into it. This is a great way to also be honest and transparent about your failures!

24. Tell me about a decision that you’ve regretted and how you overcame it.
Answering Tip: Allow the interview to see your vulnerable side and your attitude towards overcoming bad decisions.

Bonus Example: Don’t be afraid to talk about your failures, as long as you can present them in a way that you learned something from them. Go to tech communities like “F**k Up Nights” where people tell stories about failure and get some ideas on how to frame your failures.

Leadership
25. Give me an example of when you had to assume leadership for a team.
Answering Tip: Describe your initial uncertainty and how you were able to overcome it. What did you do to step up as a leader in the situation? Did you speak up? Did you facilitate?

What is the difference between frequentist and Bayesian?
Understanding the Differences Between Bayesian and ...
: the frequentist approach assigns probabilities to data, not to hypotheses, whereas the Bayesian approach assigns probabilities to hypotheses. Furthermore, Bayesian models incorporate prior knowledge into the analysis, updating hypotheses probabilities as more data become available.



Tell Me About a Time You Had an Interpersonal Conflict at Work.

Sample answer: “One time as a consultant I failed to set expectations for a project with one of my clients, leading to miscommunication and frustration. To correct this issue, I adjusted the cadence of our communication going forward and sent out status updates once a week. This allowed us to remain on the same page and helped me regain my client’s trust.”


How Have You Helped Teammates Succeed in the Past?
Interviewers may ask this as a way to gauge your skills in leadership, teamwork and collaboration. While this question is more common in interviews for managerial positions, companies that value a team-first mentality may include this question in their interview process.
Sample answer: “During my time as a sales representative, I had a teammate who struggled to navigate the team’s new customer relationship management platform. I offered to set up a 30-minute meeting with him to provide a brief tutorial on the platform. Through this interaction, I helped my teammate learn how to quickly locate customer data within the platform, boosting his productivity.”


Tell Me About a Time You Had to Manage Competing Priorities.
Sample answer: “As a copywriter, I was assigned a long-form article that was due in a week, on top of my regular workload. Because the piece would be published in a well-known magazine, I dedicated more time to the long-form article while leaving some time at the end of each day for my typical duties. By adjusting my priorities, I met the deadline for the long-form article and effectively managed the rest of my workload.”


How Would You Approach and Solve This Problem?
An interviewer may present you with a case study or coding problem and ask how you would solve it. While this might feel like a high-stakes situation, it’s OK if you don’t know the answer. Even if you don’t land on the correct solution immediately, the interviewer will glean valuable insights into how you think and whether your approach aligns with the team’s.
Sample Answer: “As a developer, I was tasked with building a new app using C++. Our team often relied on Java, so this was a new experience for me, and I made many errors in my code the first time around. In response, I signed up for several short online courses on C++, gaining the foundational knowledge needed to commit fewer mistakes moving forward and finish building the app three days before the six-week deadline.”

When testing hundreds of hypotheses, there are several things to consider, including:
Multiple comparisons problem
The probability of making an error increases as the number of hypothesis tests increases. This is known as the multiple comparisons problem, multiplicity, or the look-elsewhere effect.
Computational efficiency
Techniques like group testing and hierarchical testing can help reduce the computational burden.
Bayesian approaches
Bayesian methods can incorporate prior information and provide direct probability statements about the hypotheses.
False discovery rate (FDR)
In some situations, it's not possible to control for the family-wise error rate, so instead the false discovery rate is controlled. This allows for a certain proportion of hypotheses to be false positives. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction is a common method for controlling the false discovery rate.
Validation tests
Validation tests based on multiple testing correction, such as Bonferroni and Benjamini and Hochberg, can help correct for the occurrence of false positives.
Permutation tests
Resampling tests, such as permutation tests, can help correct for the occurrence of false positives.
There are two types of multiple hypothesis testing:
Global hypothesis testing: All null hypotheses are tested simultaneously.
Multiple testing: Each null hypothesis is tested separately.

Let’s say that you work for a software as a subscription (SAAS) company that has existed for just over a year. The chief revenue officer wants to know the average lifetime value.

We know that the product costs $100 dollars per month, averages 10% in monthly churn, and the average customer sticks around for around 3.5 months.

Calculate the formula for the average lifetime value.


Suppose there exists a new airline named Jetco that flies domestically across North America. Jetco recently had a study commissioned that tested the boarding time of every airline, and it came out that Jetco had the fastest average boarding times of any airline.

What factors could have biased this result, and what would you look into?

N
N cards.

2. What is the biggest challenge you have faced, and what steps did you take to overcome it?

The executives at my last company wanted to make better data-driven decisions.I was directed to streamline a dozen reports for our monthly
executive briefing.

I used data visualization tools to create a real-time comprehensive, automated dashboard.My approach saved the team over 25 hours monthly, helping them focus on more strategic projects.

What is your greatest weakness?
During project testing, I occasionally don’t elaborate enough on why a particular approach will have a low likelihood of success to junior data scientists on my team. As a senior data scientist, I am tasked with mentoring my direct reports and communicating effectively to avoid pitfalls during projects.To strengthen my abilities, I started taking a course on “Giving Helpful Feedback” from Coursera to expand my leadership skills and help those under me grow their expertise.By doing this, I was able to build more formidable relationships with my team and achieve superior business results.




I am a performance-driven inbound marketing professional with a demonstrated history in creating successful campaigns.For example, my previous role focused on optimizing lead generation and lead nurturing processes through high quality and targeted content.I created and executed email marketing, website updates and social media campaigns to grow customer acquisition.
These multi-channel marketing campaigns resulted in tripled conversion rates. I believe my proficiency in converting qualified leads into customers would make me an asset to your organization, and I would be eager to continue growing my expertise alongside your highly skilled team.

What accomplishment are you most proud of,
and why?
At my last company, I noticed there was no formal development program to help my peers who were promoted to a supervisor role for the first time. I spoke to my manager about starting a leadership boot camp, and he told me to challenge my thinking and come up with a strategy to implement it.
After collaborating with my leader and business partners, I was able to formulate a curriculum for a leadership development track, teaching my peers fundamental leadership skills and how to manage their teams efficiently.
I was able to successfully bring the program to life, allowing me to channel my passion for leadership while serving the community. Given the opportunity as your firm’s organizational development manager, I would love to carry the invaluable skills I learned to help future leaders at your organization.


Can you tell me about a time when you had to think creatively to overcome a challenge?" (with sample answers)


Good answer: "In my previous job as a graphic designer, a client wanted a logo design that was completely outside of our company style and brand guidelines. I knew that we needed to come up with a design that would meet the client's needs but still fit within our brand standards. I researched different design styles and came up with a unique, modern design that still incorporated our company colors and typography. The client loved it, and we ended up using that new style in other projects."

Tell me about a time when you didn’t meet a client’s expectation
Situation: “As a graphic designer, I misunderstood a client’s design brief and created a concept that was off-target.”
Task: “My task was to deliver a design that aligned with the client’s brand vision.”
Action: “After realizing the mistake, I scheduled a meeting with the client to discuss their vision in detail. I then worked overtime to deliver a new design that met their expectations.”
Result: “The client was satisfied with the new design and praised our commitment to meeting their needs. This experience improved my attention to detail and client communication skills.”


Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
Example answer: “ I can think back to a time when I was working closely with an external partner on planning an event. I was trying to set the schedule for my team, however, it would sometimes take two weeks before the external partner would email me back. I could definitely empathize with this as I know they mentioned they were managing multiple events, however, I also had to recognize that it was slowing down the planning for my team. What I did was first I would set a reminder for myself to follow up to my initial emails two days after I sent my first email. Next I determined setting up phone meetings might help the external partner communicate more information at once. This really helped in our ability to meet the deadlines we each needed.”

tell-me-about-a-time-you-set-a-goal-for-yourself-to-meet-an-objective

“In my last role as a digital marketer, I set a goal to increase our web traffic by 30% within six months. I started by analyzing our current traffic sources and performance metrics. Based on this analysis, I developed a comprehensive SEO and content strategy, which included regular blog posts, social media engagement, and keyword optimization. I also set up weekly check-ins to monitor progress. By the end of six months, we had achieved a 35% increase in traffic, surpassing my original goal.”

Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
When my previous team transitioned to a new project management software, I took the initiative to learn it quickly to ensure a smooth transition. I viewed the change as an opportunity for growth. I found the experience invigorating and threw myself into the tutorial videos to become competent before the first day of using the new system.
While some peers struggled to adapt, I helped them find their way around the new system. As a result, the department's output increased and the transition went smoothly. This experience helped me develop perseverance and adaptability

How do you react when you are dissatisfied with the quality of your work or the outcome of your work?
"I am rarely dissatisfied with my work because I keep very high standards for myself and what I deliver. With that said, should I be dissatisfied with the quality of my work, I would own up to it and try again until I was proud of the work I delivered."


Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment.
Describe a time when you had to step up and demonstrate leadership skills.
Tell me about a time you made a mistake and wish you’d handled a situation with a colleague differently.
When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs
Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?


3. Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?
A perfect answer to this question has an outstanding outcome and illustrates the process of getting to that result. But even if you only have a decent outcome to point to instead of a stellar one, spelling out the steps you took will get you a strong answer.

For instance:

“One of the most important times to make a good impression on a client is before they’re officially a client. When the sales team pulls me into meetings with potential clients, I know we’re close to sealing the deal and I do my best to help that along. That’s probably why I was chosen to represent the research team when we did a final presentation for what would become our biggest client win of the year. I spoke with everyone on the sales team who had met with them previously to learn as much as possible about what they might care about. The thing I do that sets me apart is that I don’t try to treat all the clients the same. I try to address their specific questions and concerns so that they know I did my homework and that I care enough to not just give the cookie-cutter answers. In this case, having the data pulled and ready for every question they had made all the difference in building their confidence in our company.”



Describe a time when you disagreed with a team member. How did you resolve the problem?
Tell me about a time when you failed.
Give me an example of when you had to assume leadership for a team.
What is the most difficult/ challenging situation you’ve ever had to resolved in the workplace?
Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a supervisor.
How do you approach problems? What’s your process?
Also, most behavioural interview questions can be separated into groups:

Problem Solving
Working on a Team
Biggest Failures
Leadership
Personal Stress
Now, let’s look at 8 of the most common questions from each group and a short description of the answering approach to use. We’ll look at examples of a few questions that may be relevant to tech startup interviews.

Problem Solving
1. Give me an example of when you used logic to solve a problem
Answering Tip: Employ a Situation/ Task→ Action→ Result format.

2. Explain a time when you took the initiative on a project.
Answering Tip: Tempting as it may be to focus only on yourself, don’t forget to give credit to your team, too. Try to use examples where you went beyond your day role to take on extra responsibility.

3. Describe how you used your problem-solving skills to benefit a team or company.
Answering Tip: Demonstrate how you look for solutions for the greater good of the company. Not just solutions for your own good and your team’s good.

Bonus Example: According to Bosmat, Engineering Manager at Facebook, the best way to demonstrate your problem solving skills (particularly if you’re applying for a software engineering role) is to think aloud.  The interview at Facebook for software engineering roles is part behavioural and part technical, and interviewers love to know how you think, so share your thought process openly, while using the tips the interviewers give you. Facebook also recommend familiarizing yourself with the company’s core values and vision, and joining their online talent community to network with hiring managers and other peers.

4. Tell me about a time when you used creativity to overcome a dilemma.
Answering Tip: Think about a way that you surprised yourself with an unexpected idea. Did you follow a ‘creative process’? Or was your creativity more spontaneous in the situation?

5. What’s the best idea you’ve come up with on a team-based project?
Answering Tip: Brainstorm at least three different ideas and be prepared to discuss one during your interview. Focus on the ones that had the biggest impact.

6. How do you approach problems? What’s your process?
Answering Tip: Focus on the approach you use to solve problems. How do you break them down into steps in order to solve them? What tools and techniques do you use to work through a problem?

7. Tell me about a time when you were consulted for a problem.
Answering Tip: The interviewer wants to know what you are known/remembered for among the people who know you. Do your friends come to you for relationship advice, professional advice or to brainstorm solutions? Do they ask you for places to visit around town? Think about what you know a lot about, and what your friends know & think about you too!

“We look for candidates who have a wider lens in understanding the impact of their own function, and most of all able to operate in a high growth environment with a desire to grow.”
Monica Watt, General Manager, Elmo Talent Learning

8. Name three improvements you made in your most recent position.
Answering Tip: Make a list so that you’re not stumbling over your words during the interview. Focus more on the result you achieved for this question, and have the ‘3 things’ ready to discuss.

Bonus Example: Think of a time when you’ve used an approach like Design Thinking Or Lean Startup methodology to come up with solutions to a problem. This demonstrates that you’re well versed in typical problem solving approaches used by advanced tech folks out there. Kevin Lee, Founder at PMHQ recommends asking clarifying questions and focusing on the end user, especially for Product Management Interviews at companies like Google. Who is it that you made the improvements for and why? What difference did your improvements make to your end users lives?

Working in a Team
9. Have you ever worked with a team before?
Answering Tip: Don’t just answer “yes” or “no,” but also describe your role(s) within any team you’ve worked within. Explain the focus of your team, the objectives you had and give detail on the size and growth during your time in the role.

10. Are you better at working with a team or working on your own?
Answering Tip: To answer that you’re a team player is almost always the right response.

11. Give me an example of when you worked well with a team.
Answering Tip: Make a list of these examples ahead of your interview so that you’re comfortable with these ideas. Focus on the times where you were able to deliver a business result, rather than just hanging out at the pub on a Friday.

12. What role do you assume when you work within a team?
Answering Tip: Although you may have assumed many different roles, focus on the one that showcases your skill set. Give a response that aligns with the current role you’re interviewing for

– for example, if the interview is for a leadership role then talk about your style in that capacity.

13. Have you worked on different types of teams? What was your favorite?
Answering Tip: Describe the benefit of each team you’ve worked within. Focus on the reasons why you enjoyed that team – if it was a personality and culture alignment, or you delivered an awesome project together, both work well.

14. What do you do if you disagree if another team member?
Answering Tip: Choose a time when you disagreed about a work-related issue, not a personal one, and explain how you tackled the case. Focus on your communication and negotiation skills. Try not to let your ego get in the way.

“To play sports at a competitive level you need to have a competitive mindset, be a real team player, have discipline and be open to new ways of getting better. If someone has played top-level sports I often a see them striving for the same success in their role.”
James Bergl, Sales Director at Datto

15. Describe a time when you disagreed with a team member. How did you resolve the problem?
Answering Tip: Explain how you worked through the issue – show off your communication skills, it’s ok if you didn’t come out of the disagreement on top, your interviewer is looking for your ability to handle conflict.

16. Tell me about a time when you failed in a team project, and how you overcame it.
Answering Tip: Be honest and show how you can learn from failures. Don’t blame your team members for your failure, focus on the objective reasons that led to team failure and what you learned.

Bonus Example: Using examples of a time when you’ve participated in a Hackathon usually works well for questions like this, especially if you had a good idea and got some recognition for it. This is a time where you would’ve generated a lot of ideas in collaboration with a team, in a short span of time and solved lots of problems. A great way to demonstrate that you can work well with a team in a ‘tech’ environment while also generating positive outcomes for your team.

Answering Tip: Choose a mistake from when you first started working on a job and describe your progression.

Answering Tip: Describe why you enjoy feedback, even in the form of failures. Present failures as lessons.

23. Tell me about a time when you tried something risky and failed.
Answering Tip: Bring humor into it. This is a great way to also be honest and transparent about your failures!

24. Tell me about a decision that you’ve regretted and how you overcame it.
Answering Tip: Allow the interview to see your vulnerable side and your attitude towards overcoming bad decisions.

Bonus Example: Don’t be afraid to talk about your failures, as long as you can present them in a way that you learned something from them. Go to tech communities like “F**k Up Nights” where people tell stories about failure and get some ideas on how to frame your failures.

Leadership
25. Give me an example of when you had to assume leadership for a team.
Answering Tip: Describe your initial uncertainty and how you were able to overcome it. What did you do to step up as a leader in the situation? Did you speak up? Did you facilitate?

What is the difference between frequentist and Bayesian?
Understanding the Differences Between Bayesian and ...
: the frequentist approach assigns probabilities to data, not to hypotheses, whereas the Bayesian approach assigns probabilities to hypotheses. Furthermore, Bayesian models incorporate prior knowledge into the analysis, updating hypotheses probabilities as more data become available.



Tell Me About a Time You Had an Interpersonal Conflict at Work.

Sample answer: “One time as a consultant I failed to set expectations for a project with one of my clients, leading to miscommunication and frustration. To correct this issue, I adjusted the cadence of our communication going forward and sent out status updates once a week. This allowed us to remain on the same page and helped me regain my client’s trust.”


How Have You Helped Teammates Succeed in the Past?
Interviewers may ask this as a way to gauge your skills in leadership, teamwork and collaboration. While this question is more common in interviews for managerial positions, companies that value a team-first mentality may include this question in their interview process.
Sample answer: “During my time as a sales representative, I had a teammate who struggled to navigate the team’s new customer relationship management platform. I offered to set up a 30-minute meeting with him to provide a brief tutorial on the platform. Through this interaction, I helped my teammate learn how to quickly locate customer data within the platform, boosting his productivity.”


Tell Me About a Time You Had to Manage Competing Priorities.
Sample answer: “As a copywriter, I was assigned a long-form article that was due in a week, on top of my regular workload. Because the piece would be published in a well-known magazine, I dedicated more time to the long-form article while leaving some time at the end of each day for my typical duties. By adjusting my priorities, I met the deadline for the long-form article and effectively managed the rest of my workload.”


How Would You Approach and Solve This Problem?
An interviewer may present you with a case study or coding problem and ask how you would solve it. While this might feel like a high-stakes situation, it’s OK if you don’t know the answer. Even if you don’t land on the correct solution immediately, the interviewer will glean valuable insights into how you think and whether your approach aligns with the team’s.
Sample Answer: “As a developer, I was tasked with building a new app using C++. Our team often relied on Java, so this was a new experience for me, and I made many errors in my code the first time around. In response, I signed up for several short online courses on C++, gaining the foundational knowledge needed to commit fewer mistakes moving forward and finish building the app three days before the six-week deadline.”

4. Tell me about a time when you were assigned a task outside your normal job duties. How did you handle the assignment? Describe the outcome.
5. Can you talk about a time when you adapted to a change and your coworkers resisted changing from the old way of doing things?
6. Talk about a task that had a major obstacle. How did you get around that obstacle to complete your task?
7. Can you talk about the biggest change you’ve experienced? How did you adapt to the change?


When testing hundreds of hypotheses, there are several things to consider, including:
Multiple comparisons problem
The probability of making an error increases as the number of hypothesis tests increases. This is known as the multiple comparisons problem, multiplicity, or the look-elsewhere effect.
Computational efficiency
Techniques like group testing and hierarchical testing can help reduce the computational burden.
Bayesian approaches
Bayesian methods can incorporate prior information and provide direct probability statements about the hypotheses.
False discovery rate (FDR)
In some situations, it's not possible to control for the family-wise error rate, so instead the false discovery rate is controlled. This allows for a certain proportion of hypotheses to be false positives. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction is a common method for controlling the false discovery rate.
Validation tests
Validation tests based on multiple testing correction, such as Bonferroni and Benjamini and Hochberg, can help correct for the occurrence of false positives.
Permutation tests
Resampling tests, such as permutation tests, can help correct for the occurrence of false positives.
There are two types of multiple hypothesis testing:
Global hypothesis testing: All null hypotheses are tested simultaneously.
Multiple testing: Each null hypothesis is tested separately.

Let’s say that you work for a software as a subscription (SAAS) company that has existed for just over a year. The chief revenue officer wants to know the average lifetime value.

We know that the product costs $100 dollars per month, averages 10% in monthly churn, and the average customer sticks around for around 3.5 months.

Calculate the formula for the average lifetime value.


Suppose there exists a new airline named Jetco that flies domestically across North America. Jetco recently had a study commissioned that tested the boarding time of every airline, and it came out that Jetco had the fastest average boarding times of any airline.

What factors could have biased this result, and what would you look into?

N
N cards.

2. What is the biggest challenge you have faced, and what steps did you take to overcome it?

The executives at my last company wanted to make better data-driven decisions.I was directed to streamline a dozen reports for our monthly
executive briefing.

I used data visualization tools to create a real-time comprehensive, automated dashboard.My approach saved the team over 25 hours monthly, helping them focus on more strategic projects.

What is your greatest weakness?
During project testing, I occasionally don’t elaborate enough on why a particular approach will have a low likelihood of success to junior data scientists on my team. As a senior data scientist, I am tasked with mentoring my direct reports and communicating effectively to avoid pitfalls during projects.To strengthen my abilities, I started taking a course on “Giving Helpful Feedback” from Coursera to expand my leadership skills and help those under me grow their expertise.By doing this, I was able to build more formidable relationships with my team and achieve superior business results.




I am a performance-driven inbound marketing professional with a demonstrated history in creating successful campaigns.For example, my previous role focused on optimizing lead generation and lead nurturing processes through high quality and targeted content.I created and executed email marketing, website updates and social media campaigns to grow customer acquisition.
These multi-channel marketing campaigns resulted in tripled conversion rates. I believe my proficiency in converting qualified leads into customers would make me an asset to your organization, and I would be eager to continue growing my expertise alongside your highly skilled team.

What accomplishment are you most proud of,
and why?
At my last company, I noticed there was no formal development program to help my peers who were promoted to a supervisor role for the first time. I spoke to my manager about starting a leadership boot camp, and he told me to challenge my thinking and come up with a strategy to implement it.
After collaborating with my leader and business partners, I was able to formulate a curriculum for a leadership development track, teaching my peers fundamental leadership skills and how to manage their teams efficiently.
I was able to successfully bring the program to life, allowing me to channel my passion for leadership while serving the community. Given the opportunity as your firm’s organizational development manager, I would love to carry the invaluable skills I learned to help future leaders at your organization.


Can you tell me about a time when you had to think creatively to overcome a challenge?" (with sample answers)


Good answer: "In my previous job as a graphic designer, a client wanted a logo design that was completely outside of our company style and brand guidelines. I knew that we needed to come up with a design that would meet the client's needs but still fit within our brand standards. I researched different design styles and came up with a unique, modern design that still incorporated our company colors and typography. The client loved it, and we ended up using that new style in other projects."

Tell me about a time when you didn’t meet a client’s expectation
Situation: “As a graphic designer, I misunderstood a client’s design brief and created a concept that was off-target.”
Task: “My task was to deliver a design that aligned with the client’s brand vision.”
Action: “After realizing the mistake, I scheduled a meeting with the client to discuss their vision in detail. I then worked overtime to deliver a new design that met their expectations.”
Result: “The client was satisfied with the new design and praised our commitment to meeting their needs. This experience improved my attention to detail and client communication skills.”


Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
Example answer: “ I can think back to a time when I was working closely with an external partner on planning an event. I was trying to set the schedule for my team, however, it would sometimes take two weeks before the external partner would email me back. I could definitely empathize with this as I know they mentioned they were managing multiple events, however, I also had to recognize that it was slowing down the planning for my team. What I did was first I would set a reminder for myself to follow up to my initial emails two days after I sent my first email. Next I determined setting up phone meetings might help the external partner communicate more information at once. This really helped in our ability to meet the deadlines we each needed.”

tell-me-about-a-time-you-set-a-goal-for-yourself-to-meet-an-objective

“In my last role as a digital marketer, I set a goal to increase our web traffic by 30% within six months. I started by analyzing our current traffic sources and performance metrics. Based on this analysis, I developed a comprehensive SEO and content strategy, which included regular blog posts, social media engagement, and keyword optimization. I also set up weekly check-ins to monitor progress. By the end of six months, we had achieved a 35% increase in traffic, surpassing my original goal.”

Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
When my previous team transitioned to a new project management software, I took the initiative to learn it quickly to ensure a smooth transition. I viewed the change as an opportunity for growth. I found the experience invigorating and threw myself into the tutorial videos to become competent before the first day of using the new system.
While some peers struggled to adapt, I helped them find their way around the new system. As a result, the department's output increased and the transition went smoothly. This experience helped me develop perseverance and adaptability

How do you react when you are dissatisfied with the quality of your work or the outcome of your work?
"I am rarely dissatisfied with my work because I keep very high standards for myself and what I deliver. With that said, should I be dissatisfied with the quality of my work, I would own up to it and try again until I was proud of the work I delivered."


Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment.
Describe a time when you had to step up and demonstrate leadership skills.
Tell me about a time you made a mistake and wish you’d handled a situation with a colleague differently.
When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs
Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?


3. Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?
A perfect answer to this question has an outstanding outcome and illustrates the process of getting to that result. But even if you only have a decent outcome to point to instead of a stellar one, spelling out the steps you took will get you a strong answer.

For instance:

“One of the most important times to make a good impression on a client is before they’re officially a client. When the sales team pulls me into meetings with potential clients, I know we’re close to sealing the deal and I do my best to help that along. That’s probably why I was chosen to represent the research team when we did a final presentation for what would become our biggest client win of the year. I spoke with everyone on the sales team who had met with them previously to learn as much as possible about what they might care about. The thing I do that sets me apart is that I don’t try to treat all the clients the same. I try to address their specific questions and concerns so that they know I did my homework and that I care enough to not just give the cookie-cutter answers. In this case, having the data pulled and ready for every question they had made all the difference in building their confidence in our company.”



Describe a time when you disagreed with a team member. How did you resolve the problem?
Tell me about a time when you failed.
Give me an example of when you had to assume leadership for a team.
What is the most difficult/ challenging situation you’ve ever had to resolved in the workplace?
Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a supervisor.
How do you approach problems? What’s your process?
Also, most behavioural interview questions can be separated into groups:

Problem Solving
Working on a Team
Biggest Failures
Leadership
Personal Stress
Now, let’s look at 8 of the most common questions from each group and a short description of the answering approach to use. We’ll look at examples of a few questions that may be relevant to tech startup interviews.

Problem Solving
1. Give me an example of when you used logic to solve a problem
Answering Tip: Employ a Situation/ Task→ Action→ Result format.

2. Explain a time when you took the initiative on a project.
Answering Tip: Tempting as it may be to focus only on yourself, don’t forget to give credit to your team, too. Try to use examples where you went beyond your day role to take on extra responsibility.

3. Describe how you used your problem-solving skills to benefit a team or company.
Answering Tip: Demonstrate how you look for solutions for the greater good of the company. Not just solutions for your own good and your team’s good.

Bonus Example: According to Bosmat, Engineering Manager at Facebook, the best way to demonstrate your problem solving skills (particularly if you’re applying for a software engineering role) is to think aloud.  The interview at Facebook for software engineering roles is part behavioural and part technical, and interviewers love to know how you think, so share your thought process openly, while using the tips the interviewers give you. Facebook also recommend familiarizing yourself with the company’s core values and vision, and joining their online talent community to network with hiring managers and other peers.

4. Tell me about a time when you used creativity to overcome a dilemma.
Answering Tip: Think about a way that you surprised yourself with an unexpected idea. Did you follow a ‘creative process’? Or was your creativity more spontaneous in the situation?

5. What’s the best idea you’ve come up with on a team-based project?
Answering Tip: Brainstorm at least three different ideas and be prepared to discuss one during your interview. Focus on the ones that had the biggest impact.

6. How do you approach problems? What’s your process?
Answering Tip: Focus on the approach you use to solve problems. How do you break them down into steps in order to solve them? What tools and techniques do you use to work through a problem?

7. Tell me about a time when you were consulted for a problem.
Answering Tip: The interviewer wants to know what you are known/remembered for among the people who know you. Do your friends come to you for relationship advice, professional advice or to brainstorm solutions? Do they ask you for places to visit around town? Think about what you know a lot about, and what your friends know & think about you too!

“We look for candidates who have a wider lens in understanding the impact of their own function, and most of all able to operate in a high growth environment with a desire to grow.”
Monica Watt, General Manager, Elmo Talent Learning

8. Name three improvements you made in your most recent position.
Answering Tip: Make a list so that you’re not stumbling over your words during the interview. Focus more on the result you achieved for this question, and have the ‘3 things’ ready to discuss.

Bonus Example: Think of a time when you’ve used an approach like Design Thinking Or Lean Startup methodology to come up with solutions to a problem. This demonstrates that you’re well versed in typical problem solving approaches used by advanced tech folks out there. Kevin Lee, Founder at PMHQ recommends asking clarifying questions and focusing on the end user, especially for Product Management Interviews at companies like Google. Who is it that you made the improvements for and why? What difference did your improvements make to your end users lives?

Working in a Team
9. Have you ever worked with a team before?
Answering Tip: Don’t just answer “yes” or “no,” but also describe your role(s) within any team you’ve worked within. Explain the focus of your team, the objectives you had and give detail on the size and growth during your time in the role.

10. Are you better at working with a team or working on your own?
Answering Tip: To answer that you’re a team player is almost always the right response.

11. Give me an example of when you worked well with a team.
Answering Tip: Make a list of these examples ahead of your interview so that you’re comfortable with these ideas. Focus on the times where you were able to deliver a business result, rather than just hanging out at the pub on a Friday.

12. What role do you assume when you work within a team?
Answering Tip: Although you may have assumed many different roles, focus on the one that showcases your skill set. Give a response that aligns with the current role you’re interviewing for

– for example, if the interview is for a leadership role then talk about your style in that capacity.

13. Have you worked on different types of teams? What was your favorite?
Answering Tip: Describe the benefit of each team you’ve worked within. Focus on the reasons why you enjoyed that team – if it was a personality and culture alignment, or you delivered an awesome project together, both work well.

14. What do you do if you disagree if another team member?
Answering Tip: Choose a time when you disagreed about a work-related issue, not a personal one, and explain how you tackled the case. Focus on your communication and negotiation skills. Try not to let your ego get in the way.

“To play sports at a competitive level you need to have a competitive mindset, be a real team player, have discipline and be open to new ways of getting better. If someone has played top-level sports I often a see them striving for the same success in their role.”
James Bergl, Sales Director at Datto

15. Describe a time when you disagreed with a team member. How did you resolve the problem?
Answering Tip: Explain how you worked through the issue – show off your communication skills, it’s ok if you didn’t come out of the disagreement on top, your interviewer is looking for your ability to handle conflict.

16. Tell me about a time when you failed in a team project, and how you overcame it.
Answering Tip: Be honest and show how you can learn from failures. Don’t blame your team members for your failure, focus on the objective reasons that led to team failure and what you learned.

Bonus Example: Using examples of a time when you’ve participated in a Hackathon usually works well for questions like this, especially if you had a good idea and got some recognition for it. This is a time where you would’ve generated a lot of ideas in collaboration with a team, in a short span of time and solved lots of problems. A great way to demonstrate that you can work well with a team in a ‘tech’ environment while also generating positive outcomes for your team.

Answering Tip: Choose a mistake from when you first started working on a job and describe your progression.

Answering Tip: Describe why you enjoy feedback, even in the form of failures. Present failures as lessons.

23. Tell me about a time when you tried something risky and failed.
Answering Tip: Bring humor into it. This is a great way to also be honest and transparent about your failures!

24. Tell me about a decision that you’ve regretted and how you overcame it.
Answering Tip: Allow the interview to see your vulnerable side and your attitude towards overcoming bad decisions.

Bonus Example: Don’t be afraid to talk about your failures, as long as you can present them in a way that you learned something from them. Go to tech communities like “F**k Up Nights” where people tell stories about failure and get some ideas on how to frame your failures.

Leadership
25. Give me an example of when you had to assume leadership for a team.
Answering Tip: Describe your initial uncertainty and how you were able to overcome it. What did you do to step up as a leader in the situation? Did you speak up? Did you facilitate?

What is the difference between frequentist and Bayesian?
Understanding the Differences Between Bayesian and ...
: the frequentist approach assigns probabilities to data, not to hypotheses, whereas the Bayesian approach assigns probabilities to hypotheses. Furthermore, Bayesian models incorporate prior knowledge into the analysis, updating hypotheses probabilities as more data become available.



Tell Me About a Time You Had an Interpersonal Conflict at Work.

Sample answer: “One time as a consultant I failed to set expectations for a project with one of my clients, leading to miscommunication and frustration. To correct this issue, I adjusted the cadence of our communication going forward and sent out status updates once a week. This allowed us to remain on the same page and helped me regain my client’s trust.”


How Have You Helped Teammates Succeed in the Past?
Interviewers may ask this as a way to gauge your skills in leadership, teamwork and collaboration. While this question is more common in interviews for managerial positions, companies that value a team-first mentality may include this question in their interview process.
Sample answer: “During my time as a sales representative, I had a teammate who struggled to navigate the team’s new customer relationship management platform. I offered to set up a 30-minute meeting with him to provide a brief tutorial on the platform. Through this interaction, I helped my teammate learn how to quickly locate customer data within the platform, boosting his productivity.”


Tell Me About a Time You Had to Manage Competing Priorities.
Sample answer: “As a copywriter, I was assigned a long-form article that was due in a week, on top of my regular workload. Because the piece would be published in a well-known magazine, I dedicated more time to the long-form article while leaving some time at the end of each day for my typical duties. By adjusting my priorities, I met the deadline for the long-form article and effectively managed the rest of my workload.”


How Would You Approach and Solve This Problem?
An interviewer may present you with a case study or coding problem and ask how you would solve it. While this might feel like a high-stakes situation, it’s OK if you don’t know the answer. Even if you don’t land on the correct solution immediately, the interviewer will glean valuable insights into how you think and whether your approach aligns with the team’s.
Sample Answer: “As a developer, I was tasked with building a new app using C++. Our team often relied on Java, so this was a new experience for me, and I made many errors in my code the first time around. In response, I signed up for several short online courses on C++, gaining the foundational knowledge needed to commit fewer mistakes moving forward and finish building the app three days before the six-week deadline.”

4. Tell me about a time when you were assigned a task outside your normal job duties. How did you handle the assignment? Describe the outcome.
5. Can you talk about a time when you adapted to a change and your coworkers resisted changing from the old way of doing things?
6. Talk about a task that had a major obstacle. How did you get around that obstacle to complete your task?
7. Can you talk about the biggest change you’ve experienced? How did you adapt to the change?


When testing hundreds of hypotheses, there are several things to consider, including:
Multiple comparisons problem
The probability of making an error increases as the number of hypothesis tests increases. This is known as the multiple comparisons problem, multiplicity, or the look-elsewhere effect.
Computational efficiency
Techniques like group testing and hierarchical testing can help reduce the computational burden.
Bayesian approaches
Bayesian methods can incorporate prior information and provide direct probability statements about the hypotheses.
False discovery rate (FDR)
In some situations, it's not possible to control for the family-wise error rate, so instead the false discovery rate is controlled. This allows for a certain proportion of hypotheses to be false positives. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction is a common method for controlling the false discovery rate.
Validation tests
Validation tests based on multiple testing correction, such as Bonferroni and Benjamini and Hochberg, can help correct for the occurrence of false positives.
Permutation tests
Resampling tests, such as permutation tests, can help correct for the occurrence of false positives.
There are two types of multiple hypothesis testing:
Global hypothesis testing: All null hypotheses are tested simultaneously.
Multiple testing: Each null hypothesis is tested separately.

Let’s say that you work for a software as a subscription (SAAS) company that has existed for just over a year. The chief revenue officer wants to know the average lifetime value.

We know that the product costs $100 dollars per month, averages 10% in monthly churn, and the average customer sticks around for around 3.5 months.

Calculate the formula for the average lifetime value.


Suppose there exists a new airline named Jetco that flies domestically across North America. Jetco recently had a study commissioned that tested the boarding time of every airline, and it came out that Jetco had the fastest average boarding times of any airline.

What factors could have biased this result, and what would you look into?

N
N cards.
